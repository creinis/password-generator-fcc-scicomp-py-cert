# Password Generator Lecture

# Step 1

# A Python module is a file containing code designed to perform specific tasks. 
# The Python standard library contains many modules that you can import and use in your code. 
# You can achieve this by using the import statement followed by the name of the module.

#Start this project by importing the string module.

import string

# Step 2

# You can access the utilities defined inside the imported module through the dot notation. 
# The dot notation works by appending a dot followed by the utility name to the module name. 
# For example, here's how to access the ascii_lowercase constant:

import string


print(string.ascii_lowercase)
# Output: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

# In this project, you are going to use different constants from the string module.
# Declare a new variable called letters and assign string.ascii_letters to this variable.

letters = string.ascii_letters

# Step 3

#Declare two new variables named digits and symbols and assign them string.digits and string.punctuation, 
# respectively.

digits = string.digits
symbols = string.punctuation

# Step 4

# These three variables constitute the possible characters to choose from when generating the password.
# Just before them, add a comment saying Define the possible characters for the password.

# Step 5

# Now declare a variable named all_characters and assign it the result of concatenating your existing variables.

all_characters = letters + digits + symbols

# Step 6

#Your all_characters variable is a string formed by all lowercase and uppercase letters, 
# all the 10 digits and several special characters.

#Just before it, add a comment saying Combine all characters.

# Step 7

# Now print the all_characters variable to see what it looks like.

print(all_characters)
# Output: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~

# Step 8

#It is a common convention to place import statements at the top of your code. 
# And additionally, in case of multiple import statements, sort them in alphabetical order to improve readability.

#At the top of your code, import the random module.

import random

# Step 9

# The random module contains a pseudo-random number generator. 
# Most of its functionalities depend on the random() function, 
# which returns a floating point number in the range between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive).

# Call the random() function and print the result.

print(random.random())

# Step 10

# The choice() function from the random module takes a sequence and returns a random item of the sequence.
# Modify your print() call to use the choice() function and pass all_characters as the argument.

print(random.choice(all_characters))

# Step 11

# Every time the code runs, you should see a random character from the all_characters string. 
# This is exactly what you want to achieve to create a random password.

# However, the algorithm on which random relies makes the generated pseudo-random numbers predictable. 
# Therefore, although the random module is suitable for the most common applications, 
# it cannot be used for cryptographic purposes, due to its deterministic nature.

# Instead of importing random, import the secrets module. 
# Then change the print() call to use secrets.choice(all_characters).

import secrets
import string


# Define the possible characters for the password
letters = string.ascii_letters
digits = string.digits
symbols = string.punctuation

# Combine all characters
all_characters = letters + digits + symbols

print(all_characters)
print(secrets.choice(all_characters))

# Step 12

# Although the effect might seem equal to random.choice(), 
# secrets ensure you the most secure source of randomness that your operating system can provide.
# Now, delete your two print() calls.

# Step 13

# Declare a generate_password function and write all your code except the import lines inside the function body.

# Step 14

# Your generate_password function needs a few parameters. 
# Start by adding a length parameter.

# Step 15

# At the bottom of your function, declare a password variable and assign an empty string to this variable.

# Step 16

# Below your new variable, add a comment saying Generate password.

# Step 17

# Next, write a for loop with i as the loop variable. 
# Use the range() function to iterate up to the value of the length.
# Inside the loop, use the addition assignment operator to add a random character from 
# all_characters to the current value of password. Use the choice() function from the secrets module for that.

password = ''
# Generate password
for i in range(length):
    password += secrets.choice(all_characters)

# Step 18

# A standalone single underscore is used to represent a value you don't care or that won't be used in your code. 
# Your iteration variable is not actually used.

# Modify your i variable into a single underscore.

password = ''
# Generate password
for _ in range(length):
    password += secrets.choice(all_characters)

# Step 19

# After the loop, add a return statement to your function so it returns the password variable.

# Step 20

# Finally, call the generate_password function with 8 as the argument and assign the function call to a new_password variable.

new_password = generate_password(8)
