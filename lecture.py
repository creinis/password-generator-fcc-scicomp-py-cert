# Password Generator Lecture

# Step 1

# A Python module is a file containing code designed to perform specific tasks. 
# The Python standard library contains many modules that you can import and use in your code. 
# You can achieve this by using the import statement followed by the name of the module.

#Start this project by importing the string module.

import string

# Step 2

# You can access the utilities defined inside the imported module through the dot notation. 
# The dot notation works by appending a dot followed by the utility name to the module name. 
# For example, here's how to access the ascii_lowercase constant:

import string


print(string.ascii_lowercase)
# Output: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

# In this project, you are going to use different constants from the string module.
# Declare a new variable called letters and assign string.ascii_letters to this variable.

letters = string.ascii_letters

# Step 3

#Declare two new variables named digits and symbols and assign them string.digits and string.punctuation, 
# respectively.

digits = string.digits
symbols = string.punctuation

# Step 4

# These three variables constitute the possible characters to choose from when generating the password.
# Just before them, add a comment saying Define the possible characters for the password.
